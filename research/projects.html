    <h4>Constraining the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the large-scale structure of the Universe</h4>

    <img src="/static/BAO.png" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS BAO MEASUREMENT" width="600" align="left" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale has emerged in the last decade as one of the most powerful tools to constrain 
      cosmological models. This scale has been imprinted in the matter distribution by sound waves traveling in the very early 
      Universe. We can use galaxy surveys to measure this scale, which allows to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. 
      The signal is located on very large scales, where perturbation 
      theory works quite reliably and therefore we have a very good theoretical understanding of this observable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good theoretical understanding of this signal means that even with current observational constraints of less than 1%, we are still
      dominated by statistical, rather than systematic errors. This puts Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in a unique spot in cosmology and is 
      one reason why this observable is at the core of many future cosmological experiements. The study of potential systematic contributions
      to this observable is a big part of my research and I am involved in the future <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">
      Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> experiments, both of which 
      intend to improve current measurements by another order of magnitude in the coming years (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501171v1" target="_blank">Eisenstein et al. 2005</a>;

    <h4>The baryon - dark matter relative velocity effect</h4>

    <img src="/static/ratio_model_relvel_bv2.png" alt="IMAGE OF RELATIVE VELOCITY EFFECT" width="400" align="right" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The relative velocity between cold dark matter and baryons has long been neglected since it has been considered a small effect. In recent years
cosmological measurements have reached very high precision and systematic errors are a major concern for all cosmological observables. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The suppression of growth in baryon perturbations before decoupling is one source of the relative velocity between baryons and cold dark 
      matter. This effect is particularly interesting for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, since it acts on the same scale. I study the relative velocity effect using 
      perturbation theory and observational data. The most recent constraints from the <a 
      href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)</a> have
      only been able to set upper limits on this effect, but future surveys are potentially able to yield a detection (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04720v3" 
      target="_blank">Beutler et al. 2017</a>). Studying this effect is 
      essential to avoid systematic biases in measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale, but it is also interesting given its 
      potential implications for galaxy formation models (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2416v2" target="_blank">

      million galaxies and stars. I want to explore how machine learning, and in particular deep convolutional neural networks,
      can be used to classify these objects, potentially improving the quasar and galaxy targeting for the DESI experiment. The enormous 
      size of this dataset also provides powerful statistics to constrain galaxy formation models.

    <h4>Measuring the neutrino mass using galaxy clustering</h4>

    <img src="/static/Beutler_et_al_2013_power_spectrum_final_result.jpg" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS POWER SPECTRUM" width="400" align="right" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      It is an amazing fact that we can use the clustering of galaxies to learn about the properties of some of the lightest particles in the Universe, neutrinos. Neutrinos produced during the Big Bang are still around and have typically a very large velocity. This large velocity prevents
neutrinos from contributing to the small scale clustering, unlike baryons and cold dark matter. This reduction in small scale
      clustering is proportional to the mass of the neutrino particle. We can, therefore, measure the neutrino mass by studying the clustering of matter in
the Universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big price is the detection of the sum of the neutrino masses, which is currently unknown. Several laboratory experiments try to measure
this parameter, but cosmological probes are more sensitive and should be able to measure it first. This would be a major 
      contribution of cosmology to the standard model of particle physics and could determine the mass hierarchy of neutrinos (further reading:

    <h4>Higher order clustering of galaxies in the Universe</h4>

    <img src="/static/apj397366f1_lr.jpg" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS POWER SPECTRUM" width="400" align="left" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The clustering of galaxies can be used to study properties of the Universe. A different amount of dark energy in the Universe will lead to a different clustering
pattern. Therefore by statistically analyzing the matter distribution in the Universe we can learn about the 
      properties of dark energy. Similarly, we can learn about the age of the Universe, the amount of dark matter, the properties of neutrinos,
      the nature of gravity and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A statistically optimal approach to study the clustering of galaxies is the calculation of the so called N-point functions. The lowest-order N-point function is a standard tool in such studies, but the inclusion of higher order N-point functions has been proven difficult. Higher order statistics can help to constrain the early Universe through measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity. 
      It can also help to constrain redshift-space distortion and neutrino mass measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in developing efficient estimators for the galaxy bispectrum (Fourier-transform of the 3-point function) and use them 
      for cosmological constraints. This project involves the development of statistically optimal estimators and to find computationally 
      efficient algorithms to calculate these estimators. Recently my collaborators and I developed a new bispectrum estimator (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02132" target="_blank">Sugiyama, Saito, Beutler & Seo 2018</a>), which 
      compresses the available data more efficiently and allows for a self-consistent treatment of the survey geometry. Ultimately this project will use datasets like <a 
      href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">BOSS</a>, <a href="http://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/" target="_blank">
      eBOSS</a> and eventually 
      <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> 
      to constrain cosmological models (further reading:

    <h4>Redshift-space distortions as a probe of modified gravity and dark energy</h4>

    <img src="/static/my_fsig8_F.png" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS RSD CONSTRAINTS" width="250" align="right" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The galaxies we observe with telescopes do not just trace the underlying matter distribution, but the underlying velocity field. 
      This allows us to measure distances, since galaxies which are further away from us recede faster from us, which is known as Hubble's law. 
      Beside the recession velocity, galaxies are also subject to the local velocity field, sourced by gravitational evolution.
      These local velocities imprint a signal in the galaxy distribution, which allows a direct test of gravity theories.
    </p>

    <p>
      One explanation for the accelerated late time expansion of the Universe (dark energy) could be a modification of General Relativity 
      on very large scales. Redshift-space distortions are a very interesting tool to test such theories (further reading: <a

    <h4>Detecting the cosmic neutrino background</h4>

    <img src="/static/neff.png" alt="Neff CONSTRAINT FROM BOSS" width="400" align="left" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The large-scale structure of the Universe is not just sensitive to the neutrino mass but also to the total number of such particles. 
      In particular we are sensitive to the fact that neutrinos decouple very early from all other matter (free-streaming). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale we can constrain the number of free-streaming particles in the early Universe using 
      the standard ruler technique (see first project) or using the phase of the BAO (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10741"
      target="_blank">Baumann et al. 2018</a>). Of all the particles in the standard model of particle physics, only neutrinos 
      would be able to free-stream in the early Universe, but it is possible that the Big Bang produced additional unknown 
      particles. The latest data from the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_and_the_cosmic_microwave_background" target='_blank'>Planck satellite</a> 
      ruled out the existance of additional particles at the energy level of neutrinos (weak force) but it is absolutely possible that
      there are additional particles at higher energies. Particles which decoupled at the QCD energy scale are still allowed 
      by current constraints. Future CMB and galaxy survey datasets will significantly
      improve these measurements and will be able to discover or rule out any unknown dark radiation produced by the Big Bang
      (further reading: <a 
      href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08067" target="_blank">Baumann, Green & Wallisch 2017</a>; or have a look at this <a href='https://mystatisticsblog.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/measuring-neutrinos-with-distribution.html' target='_blank'>blog post</a>).

    <h4>Primordial features as a probe of inflation</h4>

    <p>
      Some inflationary models imprint unique features in the early density field, which can still be detected with galaxy surveys today. 
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3085" target="_blank">Axion monodromy models</a> or models with 
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0005209" target="_blank">non-BunchDavies initial 
      conditions</a> predict linear or logarithmic oscillations in the primordial power spectrum. The CMB has provided some constraints 
      on these inflationary models, but even current datasets like BOSS can provide competitive constraints at complementary wavelength 
      ranges. 
      Future survey experiments like <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">
      Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> will be able to improve such constraints by a factor of 10, 
      providing new, exciting discovery opportunities. Current 
      constraints from the BOSS survey, compared to Planck for linear and logarithmic features are shown in the plot above (further reading:

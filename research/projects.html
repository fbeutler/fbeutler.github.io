  <h4>Constraining the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the large-scale strucure of the Universe</h4>

  <p>
    The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale has imaged in the last decade as one of the most powerful tools to constrain cosmological
    models. This scale has been imprinted in the matter distribution by sound waves traveling in the very early Universe. We can
    measure this scale using galaxies to trace the underlying matter density field. The signal is located on very large scales, where 
    perturbation theory works quite relyable and therefore we have a very good theoretical understanding of this observable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The good theoretical understandin of this observable means that even with current observable constraints of less than 1%, we are still
    dominated by statistical, rather than systematic errors. This puts Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in a unique spot in cosmology and is 
    one reason why this observable is at the core of many future cosmological experiements. The study of potential systematic constributions
    to this observable is a big part my research (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501171v1" target="_blank">Eisenstein et al, 2005</a>,

  <h4>The relative velocity effect as a potential systematic for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</h4>

  <p>
    The relative velocity between cold dark matter and baryons has long been neglected because it considered a small effect. In recent 
    years measurements have reached very high precision and systematic errors are a major concern for all cosmological observables.
    The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale is now one of the most powerful tools of cosmology and is one of the core science drivers
    of most future larger scale structure projects. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The suppression of growth in baryon perturbations before decoupling is one source of relative velocity between baryons and cold dark 
    matter. This effect is particularly interesting for BAO, since it acts on the same scale (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04720v3" target="_blank">arXiv:1612.04720v3</a>, 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03900v2" target="_blank">arXiv:1506.03900v2</a>).

  <h4>Measureing the neutrino mass using galaxy clustering</h4>

  <p>
    It is an amazing fact that we can use the clustering of galaxies to learn about the properties of some of the lightes particles in the 
    Universe, neutrinos. Neutrinos have a very large velocity and therefore they represent a matter component which does not contribute
    to the clustering on small scales unlike baryons and cold fark matter. This leaves an imprin the matter clustering which we can 
    try to detect.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The big price is the detection of the sum of the neutrino masses, which is currently unknown. Several laboratory experiements try to 
    measure this parameter, but cosmological probes are more sensitive and should be able to measure it first. This would be a majore 
    contribute of cosmology to the standard model of particle physics and could determine the mass hierachy of neutrinos <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4599v2" target="_blank">arXiv:1403.4599v2</a>).

  <h4>Higher order clustering of galaxies in the Universe</h4>

  <p>
    The clustering of galaxies can be used to study properties of the Universe. A different amount of dark Energy in the Universe will lead to a different 
    clustering pattern. Therefore by statistically analyzing the matter distribution in the Universe we can learn about the 
    properties of dark energy. Similarly we can learn about the age of the Universe, the amount of dark matter, the properties of neutrinos,
    the nature of gravity etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    A statistically optimal approach to study the clustering of galaxies is the calculation of the so called N-point functions. The 
    lowest-order N-point function is a standard tool in such studies, but the inclusion of higher order N-point functions has been 
    prooven difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in developing efficient estimators for the galaxy bispectrum (Fourier-transform of the 3-point function) and use them 
    for cosmological constraints. This project involves to come up with statistically optimal estimators and to find computational 
    efficient algorithms to calculate these estimators. Ultimately this project will use the datasets like BOSS and eBOSS to constrain 
    cosmological models.

    <h4>Constraining the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the large-scale structure of the Universe</h4>

    <img src="/static/BAO.png" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS BAO MEASUREMENT" width="600" align="left" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale has emerged in the last decade as one of the most powerful tools to constrain 
      cosmological models. This scale has been imprinted in the matter distribution by sound waves traveling in the very early 
      Universe. We can use galaxy surveys to measure this scale, which allows to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. 
      The signal is located on very large scales, where perturbation 
      theory works quite reliably and therefore we have a very good theoretical understanding of this observable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good theoretical understanding of this signal means that even with current observational constraints of less than 1%, we are still
      dominated by statistical, rather than systematic errors. This puts Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in a unique spot in cosmology and is 
      one reason why this observable is at the core of many future cosmological experiements. The study of potential systematic contributions
      to this observable is a big part of my research and I am involved in the future <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">
      Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> experiments, both of which 
      intend to improve current measurements by another order of magnitude in the coming years. (Further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501171v1" target="_blank">Eisenstein et al. 2005</a>;

    <h4>The baryon - dark matter relative velocity effect</h4>

    <img src="/static/ratio_model_relvel_bv2.png" alt="IMAGE OF RELATIVE VELOCITY EFFECT" width="400" align="right" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The relative velocity between cold dark matter and baryons has long been neglected since it has been considered a small effect. In recent years
cosmological measurements have reached very high precision and systematic errors are a major concern for all cosmological observables. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The suppression of growth in baryon perturbations before decoupling is one source of the relative velocity between baryons and cold dark 
      matter. This effect is particularly interesting for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, since it acts on the same scale. I study the relative velocity effect using 
      perturbation theory and observational data. The most recent constraints from the <a 
      href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)</a> have
      only been able to set upper limits on this effect, but future surveys are potentially able to yield a detection (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04720v3" 
      target="_blank">Beutler et al. 2017</a>). Studying this effect is 
      essential to avoid systematic biases in measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale, but it is also interesting given its 
      potential implications for galaxy formation models (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2416v2" target="_blank">

    <h4>Using deep convolutional neural networks to classify astronomical objects</h4>

      The <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> survey is currently collecting photometric data which will be used for target 
      selection for the follow up spectroscopic 
      experiment. There will be about 40Tb of photometric data available at the end of the project. These images contain about 300
      million galaxies and stars. I want to explore how machine learning, and in particular deep convolutional neural networks,
      can be used to classify these objects, potentially improving the quasar and galaxy targeting for the DESI experiment. The enormous 
      size of this dataset also provides powerful statistics to constrain galaxy formation models.

      This project will make use of the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Google TensorFlow package</a>, which will be

    <h4>Measuring the neutrino mass using galaxy clustering</h4>

    <img src="/static/Beutler_et_al_2013_power_spectrum_final_result.jpg" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS POWER SPECTRUM" width="400" align="right" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      It is an amazing fact that we can use the clustering of galaxies to learn about the properties of some of the lightest particles in the Universe, neutrinos. Neutrinos produced during the Big Bang are still around and have typically a very large velocity. This large velocity prevents
neutrinos from contributing to the small scale clustering, unlike baryons and cold dark matter. This reduction in small scale
      clustering is proportional to the mass of the neutrino particle. We can, therefore, measure the neutrino mass by studying the clustering of matter in
the Universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big price is the detection of the sum of the neutrino masses, which is currently unknown. Several laboratory experiments try to measure
this parameter, but cosmological probes are more sensitive and should be able to measure it first. This would be a major 
      contribution of cosmology to the standard model of particle physics and could determine the mass hierarchy of neutrinos (further reading:

    <h4>Higher order clustering of galaxies in the Universe</h4>

    <img src="/static/apj397366f1_lr.jpg" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS POWER SPECTRUM" width="400" align="left" style="padding:10px">
    <p>
      The clustering of galaxies can be used to study properties of the Universe. A different amount of dark energy in the Universe will lead to a different clustering
pattern. Therefore by statistically analyzing the matter distribution in the Universe we can learn about the 
      properties of dark energy. Similarly, we can learn about the age of the Universe, the amount of dark matter, the properties of neutrinos,
      the nature of gravity and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A statistically optimal approach to study the clustering of galaxies is the calculation of the so called N-point functions. The lowest-order N-point function is a standard tool in such studies, but the inclusion of higher order N-point functions has been proven difficult. Higher order statistics can help to constrain the early Universe through measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity. 
      It can also help to constrain redshift-space distortion and neutrino mass measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in developing efficient estimators for the galaxy bispectrum (Fourier-transform of the 3-point function) and use them 
      for cosmological constraints. This project involves the development of statistically optimal estimators and to find computationally 
      efficient algorithms to calculate these estimators. Ultimately this project will use datasets like <a 
      href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">BOSS</a>, <a href="http://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/" target="_blank">
      eBOSS</a> and eventually 
      <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> 
      to constrain cosmological models (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4560v3" target="_blank">Dalal et al 2008</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01592" target="_blank">Ade et al. 2015</a>;

    <h4>Redshift-space distortions as a probe of modified gravity and dark energy</h4>

    <p>
      The galaxies we observe with telescopes do not just trace the underlying matter distribution, but the underlying velocity field. 
      This allows us to measure distances, since galaxies which are further away from us recede faster from us, which is known as Hubble's law. 
      Beside the recession velocity, galaxies are also subject to the local velocity field, sourced by gravitational evolution.
      These local velocities imprint a signal in the galaxy distribution, which allows a direct test of gravity theories.
    </p>

    <p>
      One explanation for the accelerated late time expansion of the Universe (dark energy) could be a modification of General Relativity 
      on very large scales. Redshift-space distortions are a very interesting tool to test such theories (further reading: <a

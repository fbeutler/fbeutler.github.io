  <h4>Constraining the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the large-scale strucure of the Universe</h4>

  <p>
    The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale has emerged in the last decade as one of the most powerful tools to constrain cosmological
    models. This scale has been imprinted in the matter distribution by sound waves traveling in the very early Universe. We can
    use galaxy surveys to measure this scale. The signal is located on very large scales, where 
    perturbation theory works quite relyably and therefore we have a very good theoretical understanding of this observable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The good theoretical understandin of this signal means that even with current observational constraints of less than 1%, we are still
    dominated by statistical, rather than systematic errors. This puts Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in a unique spot in cosmology and is 
    one reason why this observable is at the core of many future cosmological experiements. The study of potential systematic constributions
    to this observable is a big part my research and I am involved in the future <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">
    Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> experiments, both of which 
    intent to improve current measurements by another order of magnitude in the coming years. (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501171v1" target="_blank">Eisenstein et al. 2005</a>; 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604362v1">Eisenstein, Seo, Sirko & Spergel 2007</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03149v1" target="_blank">Beutler et al. 2016</a>).

  <h4>The relative velocity effect as a potential systematic for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</h4>

  <p>
    The relative velocity between cold dark matter and baryons has long been neglected, since it has been considered a small effect. In recent 
    years cosmological measurements have reached very high precision and systematic errors are a major concern for all cosmological observables. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The suppression of growth in baryon perturbations before decoupling is one source of the relative velocity between baryons and cold dark 
    matter. This effect is particularly interesting for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, since it acts on the same scale. I study the relative velocity effect using 
    perturbation theory and observational data. The most recent constraints from the <a 
    href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)</a> have
    only been able to set upper limits on this effect, but future surveys are potential able to yield a detection (see (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04720v3" 
    target="_blank">Beutler et al. 2017</a>). Studying this effect is 
    essential to avoid systematic biases in measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale, but it is also ionteresting given its 
    potential implications for galaxy formation models (further reading: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2416v2" target="_blank">

  <h4>Measureing the neutrino mass using galaxy clustering</h4>
  
  <img src="/static/neutrino_mass_constraint.png" alt="IMAGE OF BOSS NEUTRINO MASS CONSTRAINTS" width="400" align="left" style="padding:10px">
  <p>
    It is an amazing fact that we can use the clustering of galaxies to learn about the properties of some of the lightes particles in the 
    Universe, neutrinos. Neutrinos produced during the big bang are still around and have typically a very large velocity. This large velocity
    prevents neutrinos from contributing to the small scales clsutering, unlike baryons and cold dark matter. This reduction in small sclae
    clustering is proportional to the mass of the neutrino particle. We can therefore measure the neutrino mass studying the clustering of matter
    in the Universe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The big price is the detection of the sum of the neutrino masses, which is currently unknown. Several laboratory experiements try to 
    measure this parameter, but cosmological probes are more sensitive and should be able to measure it first. This would be a majore 
    contribute of cosmology to the standard model of particle physics and could determine the mass hierachy of neutrinos (further reading: 
    Lesgourgues & Pastor 2006).
  </p>
  
  <h4>Higher order clustering of galaxies in the Universe</h4>

  <p>
    The clustering of galaxies can be used to study properties of the Universe. A different amount of dark Energy in the Universe will lead to a different 
    clustering pattern. Therefore by statistically analyzing the matter distribution in the Universe we can learn about the 
    properties of dark energy. Similarly we can learn about the age of the Universe, the amount of dark matter, the properties of neutrinos,
    the nature of gravity and much more
  </p>
  <p>
    A statistically optimal approach to study the clustering of galaxies is the calculation of the so called N-point functions. The 
    lowest-order N-point function is a standard tool in such studies, but the inclusion of higher order N-point functions has been 
    prooven difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in developing efficient estimators for the galaxy bispectrum (Fourier-transform of the 3-point function) and use them 
    for cosmological constraints. This project involves the development of statistically optimal estimators and to find computational 
    efficient algorithms to calculate these estimators. Ultimately this project will use the datasets like <a 
    href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">BOSS</a>, <a href="http://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/" target="_blank">
    eBOSS</a> and eventually 
    <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/" targey="_blank">Euclid</a> and <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a> 
    to constrain cosmological models.

  <h4>Redshift-space distortions as a probe of modified gravity and dark energy</h4>

  <p>
    The galaxies we observe with telescopes do not just show the distribution of matter in the Universe, but also their velocities. 
    This allows us to measure distances, since galaxies which are further away from us move fast away, which is known as Hubbles law. 
    Beside this velocity, which is connetced to the expension of the Universe, the galaxies are also subject to the local velocity field.
    These local velocities imprint a signal in the galaxy distribution, which allows a direct test of gravity theories.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    More matter in the Universe would lead to a larger velocity field and therefore a stronger velocity field. In a similar way a modification 
    of General Relativity would also affect the local velocity field. Redshift-space distortions are now one of the main cosmological
    tools at low redshift. One of the most interesting aspects is their power to distinguish between a smooth background expansion
    and a large scale modification of General Relativity, which is one potential explaination for dark energy.

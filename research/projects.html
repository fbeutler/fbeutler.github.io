  <h2>Higher order clustering of galaxies in the Universe</h3>
  <p>
    The clustering of galaxies can be used to study properties of the Universe. A different amount of dark Energy in the Universe will lead to a different 
    clustering pattern. Therefore by statistically analyzing the matter distribution in the Universe we can learn about the 
    properties of Dark Energy. Similarly we can learn about the age of the Universe, the amount of Dark Matter, the properties of Neutrinos,
    the nature of Gravity etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    A statistically optimal approach to study the clustering of galaxies is the calculation of the so called N-point functions. The 
    lowest-order N-point function is a standard tool in such studies, but the inclusion of higher order N-point functions has been 
    prooven difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in developing efficient estimators for the galaxy Bi-spectrum (Fourier-transform of the 3-point function) and use them 
    for cosmological constraints. This project involves to come up with statistically optimal estimators and to find computational 
    efficient algorithms to calculate these estimators. Ultimately this project will use the datasets like BOSS and eBOSS to constrain 
    cosmological models.

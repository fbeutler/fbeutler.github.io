<h4>Web application to organize daily publications</h4>

<p>
  In 2015 I co-founded the web application <a href="https://www.benty-fields.com">www.benty-fields.com</a>, which allows researchers to read and organize arXiv publications in 
  an efficient way as well as to organize journal clubs. Currently, I am the main developer of this website.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this website is to help researchers to organize and find the latest publications most relevant for their research. 
  Benty-fields currently hosts more than 400 journal clubs and has more than 8000 registered users.
  If you want to contribute to benty-fields there are many ways to do so. First, use the feedback option on the bottom left to report 
  any bugs, typos or strange website behaviour... usually these problems can be solved very quickly if reported.

<p>
  If you want to actively help to develop the website get in touch with me. The website is written in 
  Python and hosted on GitHub.

  <strong>Project summary:</strong> This project uses data from two experiments, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Euclid space satellite. 
  Both of these experiments measure the distance of millions of galaxies and with that, they map out the density distribution 
  in the Universe. The distribution of galaxies does depend on many properties of the Universe itself. For example, if there is 
  more Dark Energy in the Universe, the Universe expands faster at late times, which will reduce the density of galaxies we measure 
  with these experiments. On the other hand, if there is more dark matter in the Universe, it will lead to a stronger clustering of 
  galaxies and the Universe will look more clumpy. In this project, we calculate summary statistics like the power spectrum or bispectrum 
  from the distribution of galaxies. These summary statistics can be compared to theoretical models of the Universe. Such tests allow 
  us to determine what the Universe is made of (Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Neutrinos, baryons), but they can also help to determine the 
  initial conditions. Currently, we believe that a rapid expansion phase in the early Universe called inflation set the initial conditions 
  for later galaxy formation. This rapid expansion has theoretical motivation but has not been verified convincingly with data. The aim of 
  this project is to (1) expand the summary statistics used for such tests, to optimally exploit the data provided by the two experiments 
  mentioned above, (2) investigate new observables, to test the dynamics of the early Universe, (3) test General Relativity on cosmological scales.

    a second-year physics Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh. I have always been driven by curiosity and understanding of the fundamental 
    mathematical laws describing nature. For this reason, I decided to do an undergrad in physics at the Federal University of Pernambuco, in my 
    hometown in Brazil. There, I could learn the basics of different areas in physics with an emphasis on general relativity and differential geometry. 
    After finishing my studies, I received a two years master’s fellowship at the University of São Paulo. In my master’s, I started to carry on 
    research in both theoretical and observational cosmology, which is the same area I am currently working on in my Ph.D. In short, we try to 
    understand the distribution of matter over the large scales of the late-time universe and its connection with the primordial universe.

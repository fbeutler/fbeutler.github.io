  I am Florian Beutler, a researcher at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth, UK. After my Ph.D. in 
  Australia, I became a postdoc at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (October 2012 - February 2016), followed by a short postdoc 
  in Portsmouth (February 2016 - June 2017) and a Rutherford fellowship (June 2017 - December 2017). Currently, I am funded through 
  a 5-year Royal Society University Research fellowship and an ERC starter grant. I am working in the fields 
  of cosmology and statistical methods. I am using the distribution of galaxies to test cosmological models focusing on dark energy, 
  dark matter and inflation.

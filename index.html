  Hi there! I am Florian Beutler, a researcher at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth, UK. After my Ph.D. in 
  Australia, I became a postdoc at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (October 2012 - February 2016), followed by a short postdoc 
  in Portsmouth (February 2016 - June 2017) and a Rutherford fellowship (June 2017 - December 2017). Currently, I am funded through 
  a 5-year Royal Society University Research fellowship. I am working in the fields 
  of cosmology, statistical analysis, and machine learning. 
  Broadly speaking, I test models of the Universe using data collected by satellites and telescopes.

  Undergraduate/graduate students: If you are looking for a project feel free to email me. I have projects suitable for Ph.D. as 
  well as short term internships. My projects range from cosmological data analysis to theoretical work on optimal statistical 
  estimators as well as computer science/machine learning. Experience in any of those is a plus but not a requirement.

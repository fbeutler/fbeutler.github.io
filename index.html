<p><img src="/static/Florian_Beutler.png" alt="IMAGE OF FLORIAN BEUTLER" width="170" align="left" style="padding:10px">Hi there! I am 
  Florian Beutler, a researcher at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth, UK. After my PhD in Australia I became a postdoc at the Lawrence Berkeley National lab (October 2012 - February 2015), followed by a short 
  postdoc in Portsmouth (February 2015 - June 2016). Currently I am funded through a 5-year Rutherford fellowship. I am working in the fields of cosmology, 
  statistical analysis and machine learning. Broadly speaking, I test models of the Universe using data collected with satellites and 
  telescopes.

<p>
  Undergraduate/graduate students: If you are looking for a project feel free to email me. I have have projects suitable for PhD as well 
  as short term internships. My projects range from cosmological data analysis to theoretical work on optimal statistical estimators 
  as well as computer science/machine learning. Experience in any of those is a plus but not a requirement.
